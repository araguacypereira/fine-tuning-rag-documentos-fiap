            "Segunda notícia:  page_content=\"CNN —\\n\\nWhile many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, ranging from spotless minimal to ostentatiously palatial, actor Emma Roberts’ Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book — or several — with warm tones, comfortable couches, and antique curiosities in each room (also, a lagoon-style pool in the backyard for summer reads).\\n\\nRoberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror — the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series “American Horror Story” — bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover.\\n\\nFor Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead.\\n\\n“I think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 — so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.” she told AD. “I have a picture of the day we moved in… I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.”\\n\\nThe designers told AD that they want the homes they design to look as if they've been lived in for decades. Michael P.H. Clifford/AD\\n\\nThe designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts’ “Madame Web” co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio.\\n\\n“We want a house to look like it’s been there for 50 years,” Pierce told AD in the cover story. “We never want a home to look new.”\\n\\nRoberts in her kitchen's dining area. She shares the home with her three-year-old son, Rhodes. AD\\n\\nWhile most of the pieces in Roberts' home are antique or designer, her open kitchen includes an affordable surprise. Michael P.H. Clifford/AD\\n\\nIn that spirit, much of Roberts’ furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts’ most treasured artworks — a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette — hangs on the wall.\\n\\nThough many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don’t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters.\\n\\nAs for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed.\\n\\n“I remember as a kid, whatever’s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,” Roberts explained. “So I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.”\" metadata={'title': 'Step inside Emma Roberts’ sumptuous LA home', 'link': 'https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html', 'authors': ['Jacqui Palumbo'], 'language': 'en', 'description': 'While many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, actor Emma Roberts’ Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book — or several.', 'publish_date': datetime.datetime(2024, 4, 16, 0, 0)}\n"

Almost 10,000 have been displaced and more than 4,500 are in temporary shelters, the civil defense said.\\n\\nAuthorities are closely monitoring dams that are not designed to handle such a high volume of water but said there is no imminent risk of failure.\\n\\nView of a flooded house at the Sarandi neighborhood in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil on May 3, 2024. Anselmo Cunha/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBrazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with local officials overseeing the relief efforts Thursday.\\n\\n“We are witnessing a historic disaster, unfortunately,” said the state’s governor, Eduardo Leite. “The material losses are gigantic, but our focus at this moment is rescues. There are still people waiting for help.”\\n\\nImages showed muddy brown waters rising as high as rooftops in some areas, while rescue teams were out with inflatable rafts, taking people and pets on board.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, the water level in the Guaíba Lake grew five meters due to intense rains, threatening the state’s capital Porto Alegre, authorities said.\\n\\nThe Brazil Foundation, in cooperation with the Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen, has set up a fund to help victims of the floods.\\n\\nRio Grande do Sul has been increasingly hit by extreme weather events in recent years. At least 54 people died in the state in September after it endured a sub-tropical cyclone. This year’s death toll has already surpassed that record.\\n\\nThe climate crisis, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is supercharging extreme weather around the world, making many events more intense and more frequent.\\n\\nVolunteers use a fishing boat to rescue residents trapped inside their houses in São Sebastião do Cai, Rio Grande do Sul state. Anselmo Cunha/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nIn the past few weeks alone, record rainfall has triggered deadly floods and brought chaos to the desert city of Dubai; reservoirs across Southeast Asia have been drying up in a persistent regional heatwave and ongoing drought, while Kenya is battling floods and heavy rainfall that has burst river banks and killed nearly 200 people.\\n\\nLast year was the hottest on record, with air and ocean temperatures climbing beyond many scientists’ predictions. The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial times.\\n\\nThe proportion of high-intensity hurricanes, or tropical cyclones, has increased due to the warmer global temperatures, according to the UN. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer.\\n\\nA drone view shows vehicles affected by the floods in Encantado, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, May 3, 2024.
